# hack-her-413

we started off with trying to make a rfid activated smart lock (cause someone forgot their keys for their dorm so technically were forced to spend the night at the ILC) using a servo motor, arduino uno and rfiduino

then we realised rfiduino has ass documentation so we switched to wifi based (esp8266). big mistake, id rather kill myself than implement it

cpp is dumb and c is clearly superior (im still ass at coding)

so wifi didnt work and we tried to make a simpler version of the rfiduino but its rfiduino so of course it fucked us over by only detecting the program as working....when the main componenets were unpluuged. so that went down the drain

we had an idea for a frontend but the person who was supposed to do the fronend ran away lmao (the entier project is made by 2 people btw {one of who didnt even sign up [pls dont dq us :(]})

we ended on bluetooth because it was 2 am and we were running out of idea and sanity.
and it WORKED! (sorta)(not really)

it worked the night before but when we got up and tried to finish up the project is decided to give up (mood)

so we ended up writing a proof of concept, TECHNICALLY.....it does move the servo if a we enter the required password, so yeah it was a huge success
